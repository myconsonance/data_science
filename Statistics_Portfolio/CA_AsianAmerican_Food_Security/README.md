# Analyzing Variation across Californian Asian American Food Security in 2017

## About This Project
I conducted this project as part of my undergraduate honors environmental sciences thesis. Because of the existence of the model minority myth and the institutionalized homogenization and aggregation of the Asian American community, Asian Americans are often perceived by other racial communities, the media, and even research as "successful" and less vulnerable to many economic and political hardships. However, prior research reflects these biases due to the scarcity of research on Asian American food security.  

This project uses multivariate regression and nine interviews to analyze demographic data from the 2017 California Health Interview Survey conducted by UCLA researchers to see whether correlations exist between different Asian American ethnicities and food security level along with key covariates: English fluency, citizenship status, and geographic location. I hypothesize that ethnicity and food security status are correlated which, in other words, would imply that research cannot simply use aggregate measures of the Asian American community and generalize the findings to every single Asian American ethnic community.

## Primary Insights
Based on my data anlysis, here are my primary findings:
- Evidence that food security is correlated with ethnicity
- Citizenship status and English fluency are also correlated with food security status
- Asian American community is not a monolith
- Further data disaggregation is pivotal to capturing the real lived experiences of marginalized Asian Americans
