# Lyft Bay Wheels Analytics Project

## About This Project
I conducted this big data analytics project as part of my Data Engineering course during my 5th Year MIDS program at the UC Berkeley School of Information. The goal of this project was to practice data analytics on big data provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Lyft. For this project, I analyzed Lyft's Bay Wheels program, a bike sharing platform in San Francisco (with some stations located in the San Francisco Greater Bay Area), and using what I found, I created a report that states my (hypothetical) suggestions to improve and expand Bay Wheels membership options to increase profit and cut costs.

## Primary Insights
Based on my data anlysis, here are my primary findings:
- Increase Corporate, Monthly, Annual Membership Promotions
- Offer Weekend Bike Passes
- Offer Trial Periods

## Tools Used
- GCP BigQuery
